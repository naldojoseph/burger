# Eat da Burger
Eat da Burger! is an app that runs with Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, and a mySQL database to create an application that has the ability to Create, Read, and Update the database using client side interaction.


# How the app works
The app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat and then devour them. Simply enter what kind of burger you would like to order, and click "Place order" button. After you hit the place order button, the burger will appear on the left hand side of the page and when you are ready to devour it, click "Devour". When it is offically devoured the burger cannot be interacted with but will still be visible on the right hand side so the users would know what burger they have devoured.
